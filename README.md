# Doc-Chat-AI
This project uses Python and Flask to build a web app that extracts text and images from uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, PPT, Excel, images) and generates study plans using Google Gemini. It leverages LangChain, FAISS, and Google Generative AI for embeddings, vector search, and question answering.
